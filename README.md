# Kinkstruction

## Important Note

Before we go any further, you should know that this code is for an adult website. There is--and will be--no obscene or pornagraphic content within the repository itself. However, if you're under 18 years of age or are offended by viewing the code behind a site that allows graphic descriptions of sexual acts and BDSM activities, then you should probably leave now.

## So, what is this, anyway?

The idea behind Kinkstruction is to fill a specific niche within BDSM: task tracking and some social networking around the tracking of said tasks (presumably, the tasks would be given from a dominant to a submissive, but that need not be the case). Doing this can serve several purposes, including:

* "Spicing up" long distance BDSM relationships.

* Sharing tasks with friends or with everyone on Kinkstruction, allowing for commentary, cheerleading, or even humiliation. (Note that no information about users or tasks will *ever* be viewable by web crawlers or anyone who does not have an account.)

* By assigning points to tasks, kinkstruction provides a pathway to [gamification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) of BDSM-oriented tasks.

What is now the main idea behind Kinkstruction started as a much simpler web application for keeping track of orgasms and tease & denial sessions.

## Also, did I mention that it's free?

Not only free to join and use, but the software is open source (you're looking at the code repository *right now*)!

## Interesting...will it be able to do anything else?

There are several ideas in the queue (some more half-baked than others), including:

* Tasks that are dependent upon how users vote on a poll attached to the task (eg voting on a type of punishment, adding one day of chastity for every upvote, etc).

* Various games of chance that submissives can use for gambling their points.

* Repeated writing tasks--e.g. writing "I will be a good boy for Mistress" ten times. Without the use of backspace or repositioning the cursor. Point penalties apply for each mistake.

* Tasks attached to timers.

* Tasks that are built upon events attached to timers. This would allow Kinkstruction to compete with milovana.com (NSFW link).

* And several more. Take a look at [the issues](https://github.com/kinkstruction/kinkstruction/issues) for other ideas.

## Neat! Can I contribute?

Oh dear gods, *yes*! Pull requests are more than welcome. Besides creating an issue, I'm also available via email (`admin [at] kinkstruction [dot] com`).

## When can I sign up and start using the site?

I'm still working on an MVP (minimum viable product) right now. However, I have a day job, so I can't hack away at Kinkstruction as much as I'd like. I'm roughly aiming to have the MVP up and running by ~~September 15~~ the end of September (that's a rough ETA, however).
